# Supervised Machine Learning
### Introduction
This is a Machine Learning classification task. It involves predicting fake bank note. This solution can be used by financial institutions handling physical currency notes

### Dataset
The dataset used for this project was obtained from a text file link [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/amankharwal/Website-data/master/data_banknote_authentication.txt). The features in the dataset are; The variance of the image transformed into wavelets, asymmetry of the image transformed into wavelets, kurtosis of the image transformed into wavelets, image entropy and Authenticy (0 represents authetic, 1 represents fake). There are 1372 rows in the dataset.

### The Task 
I developed a Random Forest Classifier model with 0.98 accuracy score metric. This Model was tested on a new note as part of the model evaluation process
